This is an archive of my Microprocessor Applications II Final Project. This project is designed to run on a board provided by the class using the TI TM4C123GH6PM, and was loaded to the board with Code Composer Studio.

The presentation discussing a basic overview and demo of the project can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/197fCgbDtlubGbLk8y2CgNR0RfBqWDCYK/view

A video going into more depth about the code and how it works can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AfMLJa_hBS2-xkcw76l6GBSJwbvXxBDE/view
